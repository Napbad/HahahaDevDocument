# Preface

This book captures development notes, design proposals, and architecture decisions made during the development of **[Hahaha](https://github.com/Napbad/Hahaha)**, including (but not limited to):

- **Project overview**: what the project is, how the repository is structured
- **Implementation notes**: high-level APIs and key internal interfaces between layers
- **Feature discussions**: why we do it, what we do, what we explicitly don’t do, and priorities
- **Design trade-offs**: comparing alternatives, risk analysis, compatibility, and evolution strategy
- **Implementation approach**: how to implement critical modules, code organization, pitfalls and postmortems
- **Collaboration records**: conclusions, follow-ups, and next actions

## Intended audience

- **New contributors**: quickly understand the project’s context and historical decisions
- **Feature implementers**: align on boundaries, interfaces, and compatibility strategy
- **Maintainers**: build on existing conclusions and reduce repeated discussions

## How to use this book

- **Start with “Guide”**: conventions and writing style
- **Then “Project”**: scope, terminology, and overall goals
- **Write proposals in “Design”**: solutions, interfaces, data structures, and boundaries
- **Record conclusions in “ADR”**: what we decided and why
- **Keep process notes in “Discussions”**: meeting notes, reviews, and iteration logs
