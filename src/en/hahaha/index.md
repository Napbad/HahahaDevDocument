# Project Background

This section explains **what Hahaha is, what problems it aims to solve, and where the boundaries are**, plus cross-cutting basics such as terminology, conventions, and goals.

## What belongs here

- **Project introduction**: goals, scenarios, and target users (who uses it / why)
- **Scope and boundaries**: define “what we do / what we don’t do” to avoid scope creep
- **Glossary / terminology**: reduce ambiguity in communication
- **Global constraints**: compatibility, performance targets, security requirements, release strategy, etc.

## What does not belong here

- Detailed designs and interface specs (put them in `en/design/`)
- Final decisions (put them in `en/adr/`)
- Process discussions and meeting notes (put them in `en/discussions/`)

## Maintenance tips

- If a piece of “prerequisite knowledge” keeps coming up in discussions, document it here
- When other chapters reference conventions/terms, prefer linking to the relevant page in this section
