# Backend (Design)

The corresponding Chinese page (`src/zh/design/backend.md`) is currently empty in the source repository. This English page provides a **starter outline** for future design content.

## Suggested topics

- Device abstraction and compute dispatching
- CPU backend: threading, vectorization, and kernel organization
- GPU backend plan (CUDA hooks, kernels, memory management)
- Data movement and synchronization
- Error handling, diagnostics, and performance profiling
- Compatibility constraints across platforms/compilers
