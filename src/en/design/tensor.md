# Tensor (Design)

The corresponding Chinese page (`src/zh/design/tensor.md`) is currently empty in the source repository. This English page provides a **starter outline** for future design content.

## Suggested topics

- Goals / non-goals (API ergonomics vs performance vs educational clarity)
- Data model: shape, stride, contiguous vs non-contiguous
- Memory ownership and lifetime
- Broadcasting rules and behavior
- Dtype and device abstraction
- Interop: views, slices, and conversions
- Error handling and diagnostics
- Testing strategy (correctness + performance regression)
