# Design Docs

This section contains documents that are **still in the design phase** or **worth referencing long-term**. It focuses on **comparing alternatives and implementation-ready details**, but it is not the same as final decisions.

## What belongs here

- **Requirement breakdown**: goals, non-goals, constraints, boundaries
- **Alternatives**: options, pros/cons, risks, migration paths
- **Interface / protocol design**: HTTP/RPC/CLI, request/response, error codes, versioning strategy
- **Data structures & storage**: schema, indexes, compatibility and evolution
- **Testing & observability**: key cases, regression points, metrics and alerts

## What does not belong here

- Final conclusions that have been decided (put them in `en/adr/` and link back from here)
- Meeting notes and scattered discussions (put them in `en/discussions/`)

## Suggested template (recommended sections)

- Background and problem statement
- Goals / non-goals
- Options and trade-offs
- Compatibility and evolution
- Delivery plan (milestones / rollback plan)
