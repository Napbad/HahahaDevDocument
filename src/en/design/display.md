# Display / Visualization (Design)

The corresponding Chinese page (`src/zh/design/display.md`) is currently empty in the source repository. This English page provides a **starter outline** for future design content.

## Suggested topics

- Visualization goals (training curves, parameter distribution, model structure)
- UI toolkit choices (ImGui + GLFW)
- Data pipeline: what metrics are emitted and how they’re rendered
- Performance considerations (sampling, buffering, async rendering)
- Extensibility (custom panels, plugins, hooks)
