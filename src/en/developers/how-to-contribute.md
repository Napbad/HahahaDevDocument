### IDE setup

Recommended IDEs:

- **CLion**: native CMake support
- **VS Code**: install C++ extensions and CMake Tools
- **Visual Studio**: supports CMake projects

## Coding standards

### C++ conventions

We follow modern C++ best practices:

- **Language version**: C++23
- **Naming**:
  - Classes/structs: `PascalCase`
  - Functions/variables: `pascalCase`
  - Constants: `PascalCase`
  - Members: no strict rule, but add necessary getters/setters
- **Style**:
  - 4 spaces indentation
  - keep lines within 100 characters
  - add appropriate comments for each function
  - public APIs should have doxygen comments

### Example

```cpp
// Correct naming and style
class Tensor {
public:
    // Constructor
    Tensor(const std::vector<size_t>& shape, DataType dtype = DataType::Float32);

    // Public methods
    Tensor add(const Tensor& other) const;
    Tensor multiply(const Tensor& other) const;

private:
    std::vector<size_t> m_shape;
    DataType m_dtype;
    std::shared_ptr<TensorData> m_data;
};
```

### Commit message format

Commit messages should describe the change clearly:

```text
type(scope): short summary

Details (optional)

Fixes #123
```

Common types:

- `feat`: new feature
- `fix`: bug fix
- `docs`: documentation change
- `style`: formatting only
- `refactor`: refactoring
- `test`: tests
- `chore`: build/tooling

## Development workflow

### 1. Create a branch

```bash
# Keep main up to date
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# Or a fix branch
git checkout -b fix/issue-number
```

### 2. Implement

- Follow the coding standards above
- Add necessary comments
- Write unit tests
- Update related docs

### 3. Test

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Build and run tests with Meson
meson setup builddir
ninja -C builddir
ninja -C builddir test

# Or use CMake
mkdir cmake-build && cd cmake-build
cmake .. -GNinja
ninja
ctest

# Run specific test modules
# Tensor tests
ninja -C builddir test-tensor
# Autograd tests
ninja -C builddir test-autograd
# ML tests
ninja -C builddir test-ml
```

### 4. Format

Use the project formatting script:

```bash
# Format code
./format.sh

# Check formatting
./format.sh --check
```

## Submitting a Pull Request

### 1. Push your branch

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement tensor addition

- add Tensor::add method
- support broadcasting
- add corresponding unit tests"

git push origin feature/tensor-add
```

### 2. Create the PR

On GitHub:

1. Open your fork
2. Click “Compare & pull request”
3. Fill in the PR description:
   - summarize what changed
   - link related issues (if any)
   - describe how you tested
   - @mention appropriate reviewers

### 3. Review

After the PR is created:

- wait for CI/CD checks to pass
- respond to reviewer comments
- update code based on feedback
- after approval, wait for merge

## Other notes

### Working on an already-claimed task

If the task you want already has an owner:

1. contact the owner (via issue or PR)
2. discuss how to split the work
3. create a sub-branch based on the owner’s branch:

```bash
git checkout feature/optimizer-implementation
git checkout -b feature/optimizer-implementation-adam
```

### Types of contributions

Besides code, we also welcome:

- **Docs improvements**: fix doc issues, add examples
- **Testing**: improve coverage, add edge-case tests
- **Performance**: optimize algorithms or memory usage
- **Tooling**: build scripts, CI/CD workflows
- **Design discussions**: record architecture decisions in ADRs

### Recognition

Your contributions may be recognized via:

- adding your info to the contributors list
- recording your implementation reasoning in the docs
- participating in project decision discussions

## Documenting implementation reasoning (encouraged)

### Why we encourage it

Hahaha emphasizes **educational value**. Great code with clear documentation has a much bigger impact. It helps others understand your work, and also:

1. **Knowledge transfer**: future contributors can learn the ideas and details faster
2. **Collaboration**: improves teamwork and code reviews
3. **Learning value**: provides thinking processes and design decisions for learners
4. **Maintenance**: helps people understand existing logic when changes are needed

### What to document

When you implement a new feature, we encourage you to record your reasoning in the relevant docs (aligned to code directories). For example, if you implement `core/include/ml/AdamOptimizer.h`, you can add notes to a corresponding explainer page such as `explains/ml/optimizer.md`.

We fully support using AI to help with writing: you can describe your ideas verbally and let AI polish them (especially for hard-to-write formulas), or keep your own style with minimal polishing—we respect your choice.

That said, we hope to see real personal understanding and thought, rather than purely AI-generated text that is hard to follow.

#### 1. New feature implementation

Possible things to record:

- **Design reasoning**: why this approach, and what alternatives existed?
- **Algorithm**: the math principles and steps
- **Architecture**: how it integrates with other modules; interface principles
- **Performance**: time/space complexity and optimizations (if any)
- **Edge cases**: how special inputs are handled (if needed)

Example doc structure:

```markdown
## Feature name

### Implementation approach
[describe your design and decisions]

### Algorithm
[math principles and steps]

### Architecture
[integration with the existing system]

### Performance
[complexity and optimization notes]
```

#### 2. Optimizing existing functionality

When you optimize or refactor code, update docs to record:

- **Motivation**: why the optimization is needed
- **Improvements**: measurable wins (speed, memory, etc.)
- **Compatibility**: whether APIs changed and how you kept backwards compatibility
- **Trade-offs**: benefits and costs of the change

Example update:

```markdown
## Optimization notes

### [Feature implemented by the optimization](link-to-your-change)
- **What changed**: [details]
- **Improvement**: compute time -30%, memory -20%
- **How**: [technical details]
- **Compatibility**: fully backwards compatible
```

#### 3. Bug fixes

When fixing bugs, record:

- **Symptoms**: observed behavior and impact scope
- **Root cause**: why it happened
- **Fix**: why you chose this fix
- **Verification**: how you validated correctness

### Where to place docs

We recommend placing docs near the corresponding areas, for example:

- Core algorithm notes: `src/<lang>/hahaha/` (e.g. `src/en/hahaha/`)
- Architecture/design docs: `src/<lang>/design/` (e.g. `src/en/design/`)
- API docs: in header comments, and synced to relevant docs when needed

### Practical tips

1. Try writing design docs before implementation—it helps clarify thinking
2. Combine docs with code comments: comments for details, docs for overview
3. Periodically review docs during code review
4. Start small: improve docs for existing features to get familiar

### Benefits of documenting

Contributors who document their thinking often get:

- **Faster reviews**: clear docs help reviewers understand quickly; you can submit doc PRs alongside code PRs
- **Community recognition**: your thinking becomes valuable knowledge for the project
- **Learning opportunities**: documentation deepens your own understanding
- **More impact**: your design ideas may shape the project’s future

We believe: **good code + good docs = excellent contributions**. We don’t strictly require it, but we genuinely encourage it—it increases the value of your work and makes the project better.
