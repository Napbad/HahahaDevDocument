## Code quality standards

### Design principles

1. **Clarity first**: code should be easy to understand; readability comes first
2. **Modularity**: independent functionality, clear interfaces, easy to test
3. **Performance and safety**: keep performance while ensuring memory safety
4. **Educational value**: structure should reflect algorithmic ideas

### Coding conventions

- **Language version**: C++23
- **Naming**: follow the project conventions
- **Docs**: every public interface should have documentation comments
- **Testing**: core functionality should have good unit test coverage

## Contribution flow

### Quick start

1. **Understand the project**: read the project intro and architecture docs
2. **Pick a task**: check the roadmap and TODO list
3. **Set up environment**: configure your dev environment
4. **Start coding**: follow the contribution guide

### Workflow

```text
Pick a task → Create a branch → Write code → Write tests → Open a PR → Review → Merge
```
