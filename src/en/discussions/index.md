# Discussions

This section stores **process-oriented** content: meeting notes, review records, debates, and temporary conclusions made during iteration. The goal is to preserve context for traceability, but it does not need to be as polished as `en/adr/`.

## What belongs here

- Feature iteration discussions (why change, how to change, what disagreements exist)
- Design review notes (issue lists, suggested changes, and where final conclusions landed)
- Troubleshooting logs and debugging journeys (including hypotheses and verification)

## What does not belong here

- Final decisions (put them in `en/adr/`)
- Reusable, long-term stable design docs (put them in `en/design/`)

## Naming suggestions

- Prefer date or topic: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md` or `topic.md`
- Include a short conclusion summary in the title for easier scanning in the sidebar
