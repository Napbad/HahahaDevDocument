# Explainers

This section is for **explanatory documents**: how something works, mental models, and “why” explanations that sit between design docs and code.

The corresponding Chinese page is currently a one-liner; this English page provides a clearer description of intent.

## What belongs here

- High-level explanations of modules (what / how / why)
- Conceptual guides and mental models
- “Under the hood” walk-throughs that help readers learn

## What does not belong here

- Design alternatives and trade-offs (put them in `en/design/`)
- Final decisions (put them in `en/adr/`)
- Process notes (put them in `en/discussions/`)
