# ADR-0001: Adopt Modern C++23 Features

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Hahaha is positioned as an education-oriented library. To demonstrate state-of-the-art C++ paradigms, we need to decide what C++ standard level the project targets.

## Decision

We decided to fully embrace **C++23**.

### Key reasons

1. **Concepts**: compared to `enable_if`, Concepts make tensor-template error messages much more human-readable.
2. **stacktrace**: built-in stack traces greatly reduce the debugging cost of low-level math libraries.

## Consequences

- **Compiler requirements**: GCC 13+ or Clang 16+ are required.
- **Educational value**: the codebase becomes a great reference for learning modern C++.
- **Risk**: older systems may not compile directly; Docker containers may be required.
