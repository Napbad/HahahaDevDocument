# ADR: Architecture Decision Records

ADRs capture **what we finally decided** and **why we decided it**. Their value is that future readers can quickly understand the constraints and trade-offs at the time, rather than repeating the same discussions again.

## What belongs here

- Key decisions that the team has agreed on (e.g. adopting a protocol / storage / architectural split)
- Context, constraints, alternatives, and rationale
- Impact and follow-up actions (migration, compatibility, risks)

## What does not belong here

- Drafts that are still undecided (put them in `en/design/`)
- Raw process notes and review comments (put them in `en/discussions/`)

## Numbering and naming

- File name: `NNNN-title.md` (e.g. `0001-auth-strategy.md`)
- Title format: `ADR-NNNN: ...`
